        <p>Simonyan Foundation is dedicated to the memory of my daughter, Anna Simonyan.</p>
        <p>Anna had a great passion in her heart for helping the whole nation of Armenia, children and elders alike. She has initiated projects aimed at helping the needy families living in the towns and cities of Armenia. The foundation was initially a youth initiative. Anna, her friends, and classmates started helping people around them and in the process recruited as many volunteers as possible.</p>
        <p>This activity is still going on. Every week we visit the remote villages of Armenia. During these visits, the volunteers distribute clothes, food, medication, and other necessities. We also organize parties, perform musical and dance performances for children and thus inject hope in them and give opportunities to be creative. Doctors and medical personnel including professional psychologists, usually join the group of volunteers to provide consultation to the sick and to the women and children who have gone through abuse and are left to live on the streets. We have many students among our volunteers; they organize trainings and classes for the children and women to teach them to work and earn their own living.</p>
        <p>She was the first pioneer to initiate this wonderful organization.</p>
        <p>“The scars will remain reminding of the future but I wish they are not to define the future.”</p>

            <h5>Our Mission</h5>
            <p>Simonyan Foundation’s mission is to stretch out a helping hand to the Armenian people who are living in the villages and towns of both Armenia and abroad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mission-item">
            <h5>Our Purpose</h5>
            <div>
                <p>Since the very first year of its establishment in 2000, Simonyan Foundation has provided means to cover the basic needs of children and adults who have dealt with the darker side of life. Our goal has always been to enhance their quality of life. This is largely due to Armenia, being a country without medical or social insurance, having very vivid expressions of poverty and miserable living conditions, especially in rural areas. Among other things, we have ensured access to education/self-development, food, clothing and other items needed routinely such as shelter and work opportunities.</p>
                <p>Our objective is ‘not only taking people out of their village, but taking the village out of them’, and ‘not only giving people fish to eat but teaching them to catch their own fish’.</p>
